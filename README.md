Rubik's Cube Solver
===================

This is a <b>Java program that solves Rubik's Cubes</b>. 

It only shows the front face of the Rubik's Cube though, and you need to go in the method "keyPressed" of the class "View" of the code to find the commands, sorry !

Download this .jar file and just run it.
